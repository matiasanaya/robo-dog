## How to contribute

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/robo-dog.git

Check you ruby and development dependencies versions:

    rspec

Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make the tests pass:

    rspec

Push to your fork and submit a pull request. Some things that are equal parts necessary/epic:

 * Write tests.

 * Follow a sensible style guide. My pick is [this one](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).

 * Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
